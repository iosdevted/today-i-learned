# Human Interface Guidelines -iOS-

If you checked out iOS developer roadmap, you would know that Mobile Human Interface Guideline is the first step. It has a bunch of interesting information for iOS developers. I took some functions for granted but it was calculated and intended. You will know what I said after reading this guideline. But it would take a lot of time to read all these guidelines. So I will write some abridged versions on my blog from time to time. So if you didn’t check these out, you could read my summary.

## 1. Design Principles

**Aesthetic Integrity** Aesthetic integrity represents how well an app’s appearance and behavior integrate with its function. 

**Consistency** A consistent app implements familiar standards and paradigms by using system-provided interface elements, well-known icons, standard text styles, and uniform terminology.

**Direct Manipulation** The direct manipulation of onscreen content engages people and facilitates understanding.

**Feedback** Feedback acknowledges actions and shows results to keep people informed. The built-in iOS apps provide perceptible feedback in response to every user action.

**Metaphors** People learn more quickly when an app’s virtual objects and actions are metaphors for familiar experiences—whether rooted in the real or digital world.

**User Control** Throughout iOS, people—not apps—are in control. An app can suggest a course of action or warn about dangerous consequences, but it’s usually a mistake for the app to take over the decision-making. The best apps find the correct balance between enabling users and avoiding unwanted outcomes.

## 2. Interface Essentials

Most iOS apps are built using components from UIKit, a programming framework that defines common interface elements.
The interface elements provided by UIKit fit into three main categories:

**Bars.** Tell people where they are in your app, provide navigation, and may contain buttons or other elements for initiating actions and communicating information.

**Views.** Contain the primary content people see in your app, such as text, graphics, animations, and interactive elements.

**Controls.** Initiate actions and convey information. Buttons, switches, text fields, and progress indicators are examples of controls.

In addition to defining the interface of iOS, **UIKit** defines functionality your app can adopt. Through this framework, for example, your app can respond to gestures on the touchscreen and enable features such as drawing, accessibility, and printing.
